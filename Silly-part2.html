<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds 
of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink 
that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>


<p> CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p> 

<ul> <li> Cold War</li>
 <li>the civil-rights movement</li> 
 <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li></ul>
